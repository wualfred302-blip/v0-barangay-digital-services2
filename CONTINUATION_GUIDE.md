## Critical Implementation Details

### Session 2025-12-29 (Current): Live QR Code Scanner - Real-time Camera Scanning

#### Problem Identification
**QR/OCR Scanner Stuck in Loading State:**
- Scanner was getting stuck in loading state and failing to complete
- User requested live camera scanning where QR codes are detected automatically when camera points at them
- Previous implementation was file-based only (tap button → capture photo → process)

#### Root Cause Analysis
**Bug in IDScanner Component (`components/id-scanner.tsx`):**
- `progressInterval` was NOT cleared on error, causing stuck loading states
- Interval would continue running even after error or completion
- Error messages weren't being cleared properly
- No timeout mechanism for hung requests

#### Research & Planning
**Evaluated Three Approaches:**
1. **Building from scratch with getUserMedia + jsQR** - HIGH RISK
   - Many edge cases and browser compatibility issues
   - Would require handling: permission states, device access, error scenarios
   - Heavy implementation burden

2. **Using native BarcodeDetector API** - NOT VIABLE
   - Not available on iOS Safari (critical limitation)
   - Not available on Firefox
   - Too limited browser support for production use

3. **Using @yudiel/react-qr-scanner library** - CHOSEN
   - 87k weekly npm downloads (production-proven)
   - iOS Safari compatible (essential requirement)
   - Next.js compatible with dynamic imports
   - Built on battle-tested jsQR under the hood
   - TypeScript support

#### Solution Implemented

**1. Installed @yudiel/react-qr-scanner**
\`\`\`bash
npm install @yudiel/react-qr-scanner
\`\`\`

**2. Created New Component: `components/live-qr-scanner.tsx`**
- Real-time camera scanning using getUserMedia
- Auto-detection when QR code enters frame
- Animated scanning overlay with corner brackets
- Error handling for camera permissions (denied, not found, in use)
- Fallback to manual code entry when camera unavailable
- Debounced scan results (1-second debounce) to prevent duplicate processing
- Dynamic import with `ssr: false` for Next.js compatibility
- Modal-compatible for use in dialogs

**3. Fixed Critical Bugs in `components/id-scanner.tsx`**
- **Moved `clearInterval(progressInterval)` to `finally` block** - Ensures cleanup always happens
- **Added 30-second timeout with AbortController** - Prevents infinite hangs
- **Clear statusMessage on error** - Proper error state management
- **Better error messages** - Distinguishes timeout from other errors

**4. Updated Verification Pages**
- `app/staff/qrt-verify/page.tsx` - Now uses LiveQRScanner for staff verification
- `app/staff/captain/page.tsx` - Modal now uses LiveQRScanner for modal-based scanning

#### Technical Details

**Library Choice: @yudiel/react-qr-scanner v2.5.0**
- Built on jsQR library internally
- Provides React component wrapper with modern hooks
- Camera access handled through getUserMedia API
- Works in v0 and standard React environments
- iOS Safari compatible (critical for mobile users)

**Why NOT BarcodeDetector API:**
- No iOS Safari support (would exclude ~50% of mobile users in region)
- No Firefox support
- Not widely available enough for production
- Limited to basic barcode detection

#### Key Features of LiveQRScanner
1. **Real-time Detection** - Scans continuously without user action
2. **Auto-complete** - No need to press button, just point camera at QR code
3. **Permission Handling** - Graceful handling of camera access requests
4. **Error Recovery** - Falls back to manual entry if camera unavailable
5. **Debouncing** - Prevents duplicate scans in rapid succession
6. **Mobile Optimized** - Full screen overlay, responsive layout
7. **Accessibility** - Proper error messages and fallback options

### Session 2025-12-29 (Earlier): Canvas API - The Final Solution

#### Problem Identification
**Konva.js Incompatibility with v0 Sandbox:**
- User reported that Konva.js packages were causing errors in v0 sandbox environment
- v0 has strict restrictions on certain npm packages
- Konva.js and react-konva fell outside acceptable package boundaries

#### Key Discovery
**Canvas API Generator Already Active:**
- Upon investigation, found that `lib/qrt-id-generator-canvas.ts` was already fully implemented
- This file uses native browser Canvas 2D API (no external dependencies)
- The implementation was complete and functional
- This solution is v0 sandbox compatible

#### Solution: Remove Konva.js, Keep Canvas API
**Cleanup Actions (2025-12-29):**
1. Deleted legacy Konva component files (no longer needed):
   - `components/qrt-id-front-konva.tsx`
   - `components/qrt-id-back-konva.tsx`
   - `lib/qrt-id-generator-konva.ts`

2. Removed incompatible packages from `package.json`:
   - konva (^10.0.12)
   - react-konva (^19.2.1)
   - use-image (^1.1.4)

3. Verified `app/payment/page.tsx` is using Canvas API generator
4. Verified build succeeds with all changes
5. Created git commit 5e227c5 documenting the removal

#### Why Canvas API is Superior for v0
- **No External Dependencies** - Uses only native browser APIs
- **v0 Sandbox Compatible** - No package restrictions
- **Smaller Bundle** - No Konva library to ship
- **Fully Functional** - Already handles QRT ID generation with pixelRatio scaling
- **Simpler Maintenance** - No third-party library to manage

#### Canvas API Implementation Details
**File: `lib/qrt-id-generator-canvas.ts`**
- Direct canvas 2D rendering for both card sides
- Handles photo, QR code, and text positioning
- Uses pixelRatio for high-resolution output
- Returns base64 data URLs for storage
- No visibility/DOM tricks needed - pure canvas drawing

---

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case: Generate QRT ID with Photo (Canvas API)

1. **Navigate to QRT Request Page**
   \`\`\`
   http://localhost:3000/qrt-id/request
   \`\`\`

2. **Fill Form and Submit**
   - Fill all required fields including uploading a photo
   - Click "Proceed to Payment"

3. **Check Payment Page Console**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for logs with prefix `[v0] Canvas Generator`
   - Expected behavior:
     - Canvas API generating images directly
     - No DOM visibility tricks needed
     - Images export smoothly to data URLs

4. **Complete Payment**
   - Select payment method (GCash/Maya/Bank Transfer)
   - Click pay button
   - Wait for redirect to receipt

5. **Verify Images Generated**
   - Look for `idFrontImageUrl` and `idBackImageUrl` in the QRT object
   - Navigate to the QRT ID view page (`/app/qrt-id/[id]`)
   - Verify both card front and back images display with high quality (2x resolution)
   - Test Share button (should use Web Share API or copy link)
   - Test Print button (should open print window with card sides)
   - Test Download button (should save both PNG files)

### Test Case: Generate QRT ID without Photo

1. Same as above but **skip the photo upload**
2. Should show placeholder icon instead of photo
3. Card should render successfully with placeholder
4. Canvas API should handle gracefully without image

### Expected Success Indicators
- ✅ No console errors related to rendering or image loading
- ✅ Both card images visible on QRT ID view page with sharp, high quality (2x resolution)
- ✅ Share/Print/Download buttons functional
- ✅ Images are properly sized and centered
- ✅ Images can be downloaded and saved
- ✅ Fast rendering (synchronous Canvas API, no retries)
- ✅ Application works in v0 sandbox environment without package conflicts

## Debugging Checklist (Canvas API)

If QRT ID images aren't generating:

- [ ] Verify Canvas API is accessible (check browser console)
- [ ] Check browser console for `[v0] Canvas Generator` logs
- [ ] Verify no TypeScript errors related to Canvas API
- [ ] Test with simple placeholder data first (not user-uploaded photo)
- [ ] Check React DevTools to see if payment page is rendering
- [ ] Verify idFrontImageUrl and idBackImageUrl are being set in QRT object
- [ ] Check that data URL generation didn't hit size limits
- [ ] Test in v0 sandbox environment to confirm compatibility
- [ ] Verify no package conflicts after Konva.js removal

---

## Known Limitations & Edge Cases

1. **Browser compatibility:** Canvas API requires modern browser (IE not supported)
2. **Data URL size:** Very large QRT ID cards may create large data URLs (store URLs, not base64)
3. **Memory usage:** pixelRatio: 2 doubles memory consumption for canvas rendering
4. **Image loading:** External images must be CORS-enabled or loaded from same origin
5. **Card dimensions:** Fixed card dimensions (85.6mm × 53.98mm at 300 DPI) required for sizing
6. **v0 Sandbox:** Canvas API is v0-compatible; Konva.js is not
